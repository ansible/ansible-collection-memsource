## Installing this collection

You can install the memsource collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```sh
#> ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.memsource
```

To install directly from GitHub:

```sh
#> ansible-galaxy collection install git@github.com:ansible/ansible-collection-memsource.git
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: ansible.memsource
```

The python module dependencies are not installed by `ansible-galaxy`.  They can
be manually installed using pip:

```sh
#> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or:

```sh
pip install python-memsource
```

## Using this collection


You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `ansible.memsource.memsource_project`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `ansible.memsource` collection in the playbook's `collections` keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Get recent project
    ansible.memsource.memsource_project_info:
      project_name: "Foo"
    register: project
```

## Authentication

There are two supported ways for a user to authenticate with the Memsource API:

* Using the environment variables `$MEMSOURCE_USERNAME` and `$MEMSOURCE_PASSWORD`
* Using the per task level configuration modules `memsource_username` and `memsource_password`
